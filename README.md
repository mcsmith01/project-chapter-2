# Chapter 2 Project

Write a program called `FourRectanglePrinter` that constructs a `Rectangle` object, prints its location by calling `System.out.println(box)`, draws it in a `JFrame`, and then translates and prints it three more times. This is essentially Programming Project 2.1 from the book, with the addition of actually drawing the `Rectangle`.
